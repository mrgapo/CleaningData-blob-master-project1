The code points to the location of the UCI HAR Dataset directory provided in the project. The code also downloads the zipped file, 
and extracts the contents to where they can be easily referenced from the code.

The submitted run_analysis.R can be put in any location.

Location of this file must be used to setting the working directory in RStudio, using command, setwd("<<location ofrun_analysis.R >>")
To load the file, source("run_analysis.R") must be run. 

Results: Cleaned data text file (merged_clean_data.txt) and data set with averages text file (subject_with_avgs.txt) are generated and kept in the working directory
